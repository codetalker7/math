# Overview 

The aim of this book is to have the most important *definitions*, *lemmas*, *propositions* and
*theorems* together in the same place, but *without* including proofs of *hard* theorems. The goal is to have these things ready as a reference; I did this since I don't bother with hard proofs as I forget them sooner or later.
