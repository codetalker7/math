Definition 2.1 (Sigma algebras) A collection \\(\\mathcal{A}\\subseteq 2^\\Omega\\) is said to be a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra if it satisfies the following conditions: \\(\\Omega\\in\\mathcal{A}\\). \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is closed under complements. \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is closed under countable unions. Intuitively, \\(\\sigma\\)-algebras are used to define the collection of events of a random experiment which might be of interest to us. Theorem 2.1 (Generated Sigma Algebras) Let \\(\\mathcal{E}\\subset 2^\\Omega\\) be any collection of sets. Then there exists a smallest \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra \\(\\sigma(\\mathcal{E})\\) with \\(\\mathcal{E}\\subset\\sigma(\\mathcal{E})\\), particularly: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{split} \\sigma(\\mathcal{E}) := \\bigcap_{\\mathcal{A}\\subset 2^\\Omega\\text{ is a $\\sigma$-algebra}\\\\ \\quad\\quad\\mathcal{A}\\supset \\mathcal{E}}\\mathcal{A} \\end{split} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\sigma(\\mathcal{E})\\) is called the \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra generated by \\(\\mathcal{E}\\). Definition 2.2 (liminf and limsup) Let \\((A_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\) be a sequence of subsets of \\(\\Omega\\). Then \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{split} A_* := \\liminf_{n\\to\\infty}A_n &amp;:= \\bigcup_{n = 1}^{\\infty} \\bigcap_{m = n}^{\\infty} A_m\\\\ A^* := \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}A_n &amp;:= \\bigcap_{n = 1}^{\\infty} \\bigcup_{m = n}^{\\infty} A_m \\end{split} \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] Equivalently, \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{split} A_* := \\liminf_{n\\to\\infty}A_n &amp;= \\left\\{\\omega\\in\\Omega: \\#\\left\\{n\\in\\mathbb{N}: \\omega\\notin A_n\\right\\} &lt; \\infty\\right\\}\\\\ A^* := \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}A_n &amp;= \\left\\{\\omega\\in\\Omega: \\#\\left\\{n\\in\\mathbb{N}: \\omega\\notin A_n\\right\\} = \\infty\\right\\} \\end{split} \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] Or, in simple words, the limes inferior is the event where eventually all of the \\(A_n\\) occur, and the limes superior is the event when infinitely many of the \\(A_n\\) occur. Lemma 2.1 Let \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) be a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra, and let \\((A_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\) be a sequence of sets such that \\(A_n\\in \\mathcal{A}\\). Then, \\(A_*\\in\\mathcal{A}\\) and \\(A^*\\in\\mathcal{A}\\). Definition 2.3 (Borel Sigma Algebra) Let \\(d\\) be a metric on \\(\\Omega\\), and let \\(B_r(x)\\) denote an open ball in \\(\\Omega\\) of radius \\(r\\) centered at \\(x\\). The usual class of open sets is a topology: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{split} \\tau &amp;= \\left\\{\\bigcup_{(x, r)\\in F} B_r(x): F\\subset \\Omega\\times (0, \\infty)\\right\\} \\end{split} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] making \\((\\Omega, \\tau)\\) a topological spaec. The \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{split} \\mathcal{B}(\\Omega) := \\mathcal{B}(\\omega, \\tau) := \\sigma(\\tau) \\end{split} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] generated by open sets is called the Borel \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra on \\(\\Omega\\). Sets \\(A\\in\\mathcal{B}(\\Omega, \\tau)\\) are called Borel sets or Borel measurable sets. Definition 2.4 (Trace of a class of sets) Let \\(\\mathcal{A}\\subset 2^\\Omega\\) be an arbitrary class of subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) and let \\(A\\in 2^\\Omega\\setminus \\{\\phi\\}\\). The class \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{split} \\mathcal{A}|_{A} := \\left\\{A\\cap B: B\\in\\mathcal{A}\\right\\}\\subset 2^A \\end{split} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] is called the trace or restriction of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) onto \\(A\\). Theorem 2.2 Let \\(A\\subset \\Omega\\) be a non-empty set and let \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) be a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra. Then the trace \\(\\mathcal{A}|_{A}\\) is a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra on \\(A\\). "],["set-functions.html", "2.2 Set Functions", " 2.2 Set Functions The goal of set functions is to assign weights to each event of a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra. This development eventually leads to what we call probability spaces. Definition 2.5 Let \\(\\mathcal{A}\\subset 2^\\Omega\\) be a class of sets and let \\(\\mu:\\mathcal{A}\\to[0, \\infty]\\) be a set function. Then, \\(\\mu\\) is monotone if \\(\\mu(A)\\le \\mu(B)\\) for any two sets \\(A, B\\in\\mathcal{A}\\) with \\(A\\subset B\\). additive if \\(\\mu\\left(\\biguplus_{i = 1}^n A_i\\right) = \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\mu(A_i)\\) for any choice of finitely many mutually disjoint sets \\((A_i)_{i = 1}^n\\in\\mathcal{A}\\) with \\(\\bigcup_{i = 1}^n A_i\\in \\mathcal{A}\\). \\(\\sigma\\)-additive if \\(\\mu\\left(\\biguplus_{i = 1}^\\infty A_i\\right) = \\sum_{i = 1}^\\infty \\mu(A_i)\\) for any choice of countably many mutually disjoint sets \\((A_i)_{i = 1}^\\infty\\in\\mathcal{A}\\) with \\(\\bigcup_{i = 1}^\\infty A_i\\in \\mathcal{A}\\). subadditive if for any choice of finitely many sets \\(A\\in\\mathcal{A}\\), \\((A_i)_{i = 1}^n\\in\\mathcal{A}\\) with \\(A\\subseteq \\bigcup_{i = 1}^n A_i\\) we have \\(\\mu(A)\\le \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\mu(A_i)\\). \\(\\sigma\\)-subadditive if for any choice of countably many sets \\(A\\in\\mathcal{A}\\), \\((A_i)_{i = 1}^\\infty\\in\\mathcal{A}\\) with \\(A\\subseteq \\bigcup_{i = 1}^\\infty A_i\\) we have \\(\\mu(A)\\le \\sum_{i = 1}^\\infty \\mu(A_i)\\). Remark. The notion of countably many objects becomes important when we move from discrete spaces to uncoutable spaces (like \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\)). It’s impossible to assign probability weights to all subsets of an uncountable space, and still have a working theory of probability. For this reason, we must choose a much smaller (countable) collection of events which are interesting to work with. Definition 2.6 (Measures) Let \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) be a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra. A set function \\(\\mu:\\mathcal{A}\\to[0, \\infty]\\) is called a measure on \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) if it satisfies the following conditions: \\(\\mu(\\phi) = 0\\). \\(\\mu\\) is \\(\\sigma\\)-additive. Furthermore, \\(\\mu\\) is called a probability measure if \\(\\mu(\\Omega) = 1\\). \\(\\mu\\) is said to be finite if \\(\\mu(A) &lt; \\infty\\) for every \\(A\\in\\mathcal{A}\\), and \\(\\mu\\) is said to be \\(\\sigma\\)-finite if there exists a sequence of sets \\((\\Omega_n)_{n = 1}^\\infty\\in\\mathcal{A}\\) such that \\(\\Omega = \\bigcup_{n = 1}^\\infty\\Omega_n\\) and \\(\\mu(\\Omega_n) &lt; \\infty\\) for all \\(n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\).

This will be helpful to computer scientists who don’t want to deal with abstract notions pertaining to manifold theory. Definition 3.1 (Smooth Manifolds) A subset \\(M\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\) is a smooth \\(k\\)-dimensional manifold if locally it is the graph of a \\(\\mathscr{C}^1\\) mapping \\(\\boldsymbol{f}\\) expressing \\(n - k\\) variables as functions of the other \\(k\\) variables. In this book, we don’t deal with topological manifolds, but only subsets of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) for any \\(n\\). 3.2.1 Identifying manifolds, and manifolds under smooth transformations. Theorem 3.3 (Using the implicit function theorem to identify manifolds) Here’s how to show that a set represented as a locus is a smooth manifold: Let \\(U\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\) be open, \\(\\boldsymbol{F}:U\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n - k}\\) be a \\(\\mathscr{C}^1\\) mapping. Let \\(M\\) be a subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) such that \\[ \\begin{aligned} M\\cap U &amp;= \\left\\{\\boldsymbol{z}\\in U | \\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{z}) = \\boldsymbol{0}\\right\\} \\end{aligned} \\] If \\(D\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{z})\\) is onto for every \\(\\boldsymbol{z}\\in M\\cap U\\), then \\(M\\cap U\\) is a smooth \\(k\\)-dimensional manifold embedded in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). If every \\(z\\in M\\) is in such a \\(U\\), then \\(M\\) is a \\(k\\)-dimensional manifold. Conversely, if \\(M\\) is a smooth \\(k\\)-dimensional manifold embedded in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), then every point \\(\\boldsymbol{z}\\in M\\) has a neighborhood \\(U\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n\\) such that there exists a \\(\\mathscr{C}^1\\) mapping \\(\\boldsymbol{F}:U\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n - k}\\) with \\(D\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{z})\\) onto and \\(M\\cap U = \\left\\{\\boldsymbol{y}|\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{y}) = 0\\right\\}\\). The above theorem makes it easy to identify/prove that a certain object is a smooth manifold, without knowing the overall geometry of the object. The next theorem shows that the inverse image of a manifold under a sufficiently nice transformation still results in a smooth manifold. Theorem 3.4 Let \\(M\\subset \\mathbb{R}^m\\) be a \\(k\\)-dimensional manifold, \\(U\\) an open subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), and \\(\\boldsymbol{f}:U\\to \\mathbb{R}^m\\) a \\(\\mathscr{C}^1\\) mapping whose derivative \\(D\\boldsymbol{f}(\\boldsymbol{x})\\) is surjective at every point \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\in \\boldsymbol{f}^{-1}(M)\\). Then the inverse image \\(\\boldsymbol{f}^{-1}(M)\\) is a submanifold of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) of dimension \\(k + n - m\\). Remark (Manifolds under rotations and translations are still manifolds). As a corollary of Theorem 3.4, it’s easy to show that for a mapping of the form \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\mapsto A\\boldsymbol{x} + \\boldsymbol{c}\\) with \\(A\\) invertible, the image of a manifold is still a manifold.
